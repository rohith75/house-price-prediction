# house-price-prediction
Developed a machine learning web application that predicts house prices based on area and number of bedrooms. Implemented a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn and built an interactive user interface using Streamlit. The project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction.
